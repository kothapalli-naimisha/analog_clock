# ANALOG CLOCK

I've created a Python Analog Clock using tkinter

tkinter is Python's standard interface to Tk Graphical User Interface(GUI) toolkit

In this project I've used PIL(Pythong Imaging Library) module. 
PIL is used for adding support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
